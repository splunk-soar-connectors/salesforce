<p>
In order to run any actions on this app, you must first authorize the use of this app by running test connectivity.
To pass test connectivity, you need to configure an app on Salesforce. But first, in the asset configure, take note of the
URL which is generated.
<a href="/app_resource/salesforce_6c1316b0-88a7-4864-b684-3170f6c455be/img/asset_config.png">
    <img src="/app_resource/salesforce_6c1316b0-88a7-4864-b684-3170f6c455be/img/asset_config.png">
</a><br>
Then, when you are creating a new connected app on Salesforce, select "Enable OAuth Settings", and be sure to fill it out like the picture below.
It is important get the set the correct scopes, as well as the callback URL.
<a href="/app_resource/salesforce_6c1316b0-88a7-4864-b684-3170f6c455be/img/app_config.png">
    <img src="/app_resource/salesforce_6c1316b0-88a7-4864-b684-3170f6c455be/img/app_config.png">
</a>
Note that the callback URL is the same as just the URL from earlier, with "start_oauth" appended at the end.<br><br>
Now when you run test connectivity, a link will appear in the modal. Copy this and open it in a new tab.
<a href="/app_resource/salesforce_6c1316b0-88a7-4864-b684-3170f6c455be/img/modal.png">
    <img src="/app_resource/salesforce_6c1316b0-88a7-4864-b684-3170f6c455be/img/modal.png">
</a>
Here, you will be directed to login to Salesforce, then authorize the use the app. After that, you can close the tab when instructed to,
and test connectivity should successfully finish.<br>
</p>
<p>
If you optionally specify username and password in the configuration, connecting will work differently;
the main difference being that you will not need to manually login to Salesforce during test connectivity
to authorize the app. The Password field should be composed of your password with your account's security token appended at the end
(this is not the same as the <b>client_secret</b>).  If you wish to connect over a proxy, you should use this method.
