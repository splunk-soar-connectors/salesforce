In order to create an app asset, there needs to be a corresponding Salesforce App created, which has OAuth enabled.
The newly created salesforce app must have the scopes enabled to allow access to the API, as well as refresh tokens and offline access.
Set the callback URL to the provided URL at the bottom of the asset page, and append <b>/start_oauth</b> to the end.
For example, https://172.16.217.129/rest/handler/salesforce_6c1316b0-88a7-4864-b684-3170f6c455be/salesforce/start_oauth.
After creating the Salesforce App, or updating an existing one, you will be able to copy the Client ID and Client Secret
to the asset configuration.

<p>
In order to run any actions on this app, you must first authorize the use of this app by running test connectivity.
During test connectivty, you will be instructed to to follow a link, which will redirect you to the Salesforce login
and ask you to login and authorize usage of the Salesforce app.
</p>
<p>
If you optionally specify username and password in the configuration, connecting will work differently, the main difference being that you will not need to manually login
to Salesforce during test connectivity to authorize the app. Also, if you wish to connect over a proxy, you should use this method. It should be noted
that this method is considered less secure.
